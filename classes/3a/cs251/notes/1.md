Mips is an Assembly Language

## Registers
$0 to $32 are registers. They act like variables.  
$0 is always 0 and when it is overwritten, it is still 0.  

## Operations
R-Format
```
add $1, $2, $3
```
Adds the value of $2 and $3 and stores it in $1

I-Format
```
addi $1, $2, 200
```
Adds the value of $2 to 200 and stores it in $1

J-Format
```
j 20
```
PC = 20*4
This is used for branching, and the PC goes to that specific value

beq - registers not equal
```
beq $1, $2, 100
```
This checks if $1 and $2 are equal, if they are it goes to PC=PC+4+100*4
bne - registers not equal
```
bne $2, $0, âˆ’3
```
This checks if $1 and $2 are not equal, if they aren't it goes to PC=PC+4-3*4

lw - load word
```
100: lw $1, 100($2)
```
Goes to memory location 100 + $2 and loads the value from $1
sw - store word
```
100: sw $1, 100($2)
```
Goes to memory location 100 + $2 and stores the value from $1
