### Negation

Truth Table

| A | B | A $$\land$$ B| A $$\lor$$ B |
| :------ |:--- | :--- | : --- |
| True | True | True | True |
| True | False | False | True |
| False | True | False | True |
| False | False | False | False |

The $$\land$$ acts as "AND" and it is False when there is at least one False, and True otherwise.  
The $$\lor$$ acts as "OR" and it is True when there is at least one True, and False otherwise.

$$\lnot$$ denotes a "NOT" sign

| A | B | $$\lnot$$A |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| True | True | False |
| True | False | False |
| False | True | True |
| False | False | True |

## De Morgan's Laws:

### Law 1:

$$\lnot$$ ($$\lnot$$ A) = A

### Law 2:

($$\lnot$$A)∨($$\lnot$$B) ≡ $$\lnot$$(A ∧ B)  
($$\lnot$$A)∧($$\lnot$$B) ≡ $$\lnot$$(A ∨ B)

### Law 3:  
(A ∧ B) ∧ C ≡ A ∧ (B ∧ C)  
(A ∨ B) ∨ C ≡ A ∨ (B ∨ C)  
associativity law  


**Proving Law 2**

**Start out with:** $$\lnot$$(($$\lnot$$A)∧($$\lnot$$B))   
$$\lnot$$(($$\lnot$$A)∧($$\lnot$$B))  ≡ ($$\lnot$$($$\lnot$$A))∨($$\lnot$$($$\lnot$$B))  
**The ($$\lnot$$A)∧($$\lnot$$B) undergoes negation**  
≡ (A) ∨ (B)  
**This yields just (A) ∨ (B)**

**Knowing Law 1**  
($$\lnot$$A)∧($$\lnot$$B) ≡ $$\lnot$$($$\lnot$$($$\lnot$$A)∧($$\lnot$$B))) ≡ $$\lnot$$(A ∨ B)  


By negating (A) ∨ (B), we can get:
($$\lnot$$A)∧($$\lnot$$B) ≡ $$\lnot$$(A ∨ B)

## Implication

**Hypothesis:**
If ... then

**Conclusion:**
then...

| A | B | A $$\Rightarrow$$ B|
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| True | True | True |
| True | False | False |
| False | True | True |
| False | False | True |

**If A, then B**  

Think of this like "If you give me $100, I will give you $200 tomorrow."
**The implication is similar to if I keep my promise in this situation.**

If the hypothesis is correct (I gave you $100 to begin with), then the implication is true if I give you back $200 tomorrow, or false I accept the money and do not give you back the money.

The hypothesis is false if you do not give me $100. I may give you $200 regardless tomorrow, making the implication true.

The hypothesis can also be false if you do not give me money, and I give you no money. In this case, the implication is also true.


Here are four implications. Only one is false. Identify the false implication.  
1. If x is a real number and $$x^2$$ < 0, then $$x^4$$ ≥ 0.  
2. If x is a real number and $$x^2$$ < 0 then $$x^4$$ < 0.  
3. If n is a positive integer, then $$n^2$$ +13 is not a perfect square.  
4. If n is an integer and $$2^{2n}$$ is an odd integer, then $$2^{−2n}$$ is an odd integer.  

**Only the implication “If n is a positive integer, then $$n^2$$ + 13 is not a perfect square.” is false.**
