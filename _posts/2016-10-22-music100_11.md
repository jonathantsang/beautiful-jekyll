**modulation:** changing from one key to another  
**libretto:** A libretto is the text used in, or intended for, an extended musical work such as an opera, operetta, masque, oratorio, cantata or musical.  
**chorus:** chorus contains the main idea, or big picture, of what is being expressed lyrically and musically.
**Theme and variation:** involves idea of contrast, theme is presented and played several times where it is varied in melody ,rhythm, dynamics, tempo, or harmony. The theme is recognizably changed and yet recognizably the same.  **meter:** the recurring pattern of stresses or accents that provide the pulse or beat
**texture:** the way different music sounds are combined
**absolute music:** Music that has no meaning outside the meaning of the music itself and the feelings it produces in its listeners
**Program music:** Music that tells some kind of story

## Medieval:  
- written primarily to accompany religious services  
- the oldest surviving written music from the middle ages dates from about 800, but may be older  
- later in the period, secular songs, songs with nonreligious tops became popular  
- polphony music containing more than one line started to appear  

Plainchant (plainsong):  
- Greogrian chant after Pope Gregory I  
- polyphonic, one line at a time  
- syllabic, one note for every syllable, or melismatic large number of notes per single syllable  
- neumatic small number of notes per syllable  

earliest polyphony was organum (12th-13th centuries). Initially, voices added above and below in parallel. Independent movement was an important development.

Kyrie (plainchant)  

Plainchant:  
- flowing rhythm no clearly defined beat  
- single musical line, without harmony  
- use of modes, rather than scales  

Secular Song and Polyphony:  
- Troubadours and trouveres  

Peritonus Alleluya, Nativitas  (Magister Leonin)  

Two composers created first great collection of compositions Magnus Liber and Organi  

Fundamentals of Medieval Music:  
- based on modes, not major scales  
- plainchant was sung in unison, with no harmony or accompaniment  
- stylized courtly love songs became popular  
- instruments varied  
- polyphony was invented  

## Renaissance Era:  
- rebirth  

Three major changes:  
- new focus on individual achievement  
- greater focus on the daily world than on the spiritual afterlife  
- widespread mingling of cultures, facilitated by easier travel and spread of printed materials  

- music followed imitation where the opening of the same melody is performed by different voices entering one at a time  
- still primarily modal, although some more modern harmony  

A cappella - no instrumental accompaniment  

liturgical music: for the masses  
motets: songs that have religious texts but are not part of the actual services  
secular: nonreligious songs  

motet: four voice parts, small choir rather than soloists  
word painting: echoing the meaning of words in music  

Chansons (France), madrigals (Italy - England): 3 or 4 voices, mostly courtly love songs  

Dance music (see note pp. 113): there was always dance music but once again, publishing served a growing market.  


Instrumental forms -> earliest published instrumental music. Wide variety - pavanes, allemandes, bourees, gigues, rondes, courantes, galliardes, sicilianos, salterellos, etc.  

fundamentals:  
- sound is smooth and homogenous  
- harmony still primarily based on modes  
- most prominent feature is imitation  
- vocal genres includes Mass movements, motets, and secular songs  
- motets and madrigals: often use word-painting, which can involve dissonance  
- instrumental music is either serious and imitatitve or light and dancelike  

## Baroque:  
- emphasis on scientific understanding and measurement  
- interest in balance, order, and organization  
- artists highlighted contrasting emotions  
- illusion was highly prized  

Vocal forms:  
- opera: large scale stage productions featuring music, dance, costumes, and elborate plots and settings  
- cantata: short-unstaged operas portraying a single scene  
church cantata: religious subject  
chamber cantata: secular subject  
- oratorio: opera-like work with religious theme, not short  
- chorale: protestant hymm sung in unison by the entire congregation with a simple melody and regular rhythm

doctrine of affections (affektenlehre). . . in Baroque terms, music not only ought to arouse emotions - it actually makes the listener experience certain emotions.  

conventions:  
- Overture  
- Recitatives:  used for carrying forward the plot, simple fast speechlike  
- Arias  
- Ensembles  
- Choruses  

Instrumental Forms:  
- concerto: instrumental work based on opposition of two groups  
concerto grosso (large concerto) full orchestra and small group of soloists  
### solo concerto: full orchestra and single soloist  
- sonata: chamber work for a small group  
sonata da camera(chamber sonata): movements based on dance rythms  
sonata da chiesa(church sonata): more serious movements alternating slow and fast  
- dance suite: series of short, contrasting dance movements  

basso continuo: strong bass line in Baroque music.  

dance suite, not for dancing independent genre:  
**allemande:** duple, moderate tempo, continuous motion  
**courante:** triple. moderate to fast, motion often in running scales  
**sarabande:** triple, slow, stately, accent often on second beat  
**gigue:** usually 6/8, fst, lively, often imitatitve  

### Cantata (sacred and secular)  
Work for vocalists w\instrumental acc. (choruses added later), poetic text  
Italian cantata: 3 genres: lyric, dramatic, narrative  

###  Passions  
Passion plays (depiction of the last days and Crucifixion of Christ) - earliest known form of European theatre. Not surprising that music is incorporated early on.  

### Sonata  
note that “sonata” is a confusing term that shifts its meaning over time.  
several movements or sections of contrasting nature (not essentially different from a suite)  
chamber sonata (da camera): dance origin  
church sonata (de chiessa): more serious, polyphonic  
small # of instruments (1-8)  


Concerto  
note later, slightly different, classical sense  
Contrast - two groups  
either solo concerto or concerto grosso (concertino-small grp, ripieno or tutti ("all")-large group)  

**ritornello:** contrast between the solo instruments and the orchestra  
**reformation:** church music:  
chorale: hymm with steady rhythm and simple tune usually sung in unison by the whole congregation  
oratoria: large-scale work like an opera but is a sacred story not staged. (similar to Passion)  

Bach:
- composed in all Baroque instrumental and vocal styles, except opera  
- master of counterpoint and his works have served as models for composers and students ever since  
- wrote different music depending on the job he had currently:  
early years (organist) primarily organ music  
middle years (leading orchestra in Cothen) keyboard and instrumental music  
final years (working in a church school in Leipzig) primarily religious   choral music, as well as some final instrumental works  

2 wives, at least 19 children. . . 4 became composers of note (Johann Christoph, Johann Christian, Carl Philipp Emanuel, Wilhelm Friedemann).

**prelude:** rambling, improvisatory piece that organists play to fill in before, during, and after church service.  
**fugue:** carefully worked out polyphonic composition that uses a theme that occurs in all voices of musical lines

**Music Offering:** two fugues, ten canons and a trio sonata by Bach. Shows skill at counterpoint.

**fundamentals of baroque:**  
- instrumental music is as important as vocal music  
- opera was invented, with vocal forms divided between recitative and aria  
- principal vocal genres are opera, cantata, and oratorio  
- principal instrumental genres are sonata, suite, and concerto  
- music is organized by a hierarchy of chord and keys (tonal harmony)  
- unifying feature of all Baroque music is the basso continuo

## Classical Period (1750-1800/(25?))
- "age of reason" - applied scientific methods to human society
- elevated science/the rational over religion/faith - rejected superstition, prejudice, and long-held beliefs in favour of what could be measured scientifically
- "All men are created equal" valued individual freedom and equality over the older class system

The Enlightenment: late 18th - early 19th century (Age of Reason)  

characteristics of Classical Era:
- balanced melodic phrases  
- simple harmonies

Forms of Classical Music:
- sonata form: intellectually demanding, composers used it for their most serious ideas(had exposition, development, and recapulation)  
- minuet-and-trio-form: third movements in sonatas, symphonies, and string quartets (3/4 meter, moderate tempo)triple metre, AABB	CCDD	AABB (or AB)  
- aria form: simple (melody first key, new melody new key, repeated from first key, slightly modified)   
- rondo form: fourth movement, fairly lively or catchy tune
