Two events are independent if they do not influence each other.

Events A and B are **independent**  
if and only if P (A ∩ B) = P (A) P (B)

## Conditional Probability
For any two events A and B with P(B) ˃ 0,  
the conditional probability of A given B has occurred is defined by  
P (A \| B) = $$\frac{P (A ∩ B)}{P (A)}$$

￼P(A|B) + P($$A^c$$|B) =1

P (A ∩ B) = P (A \| B)P (A)

Then A and B are **independent**  
if and only if either of the statements is true  
P (A) = P (A \| B)  

### Terminology
- A false positive results when a test indicates a positive status when the true status is negative (T \| $$D^c$$)  
- A false negative results when a test indicates a negative status when the true status is positive ($$T^c$$ \| D)  
- The Sensitivity(true positive rate )of a test is a probability of a positive test result given the presence of the disease P(T \| D).  
- The Specificity (true negative rate) of a test is a probability of a negative test result given the absence of the disease P($$T^c$$ \| $$D^c$$)  

Sensitivity is complementary to the false negative rate.  
P(T \| D) + ($$T^c$$ \| D) = 1  
• Specificity is complementary to the false positive rate.   
ccc P($$T^c$$ \| $$D^c$$)+(T \| $$D^c$$)= 1
