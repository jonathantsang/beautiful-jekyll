Marmoset
Assignments are submitted to the Marmoset submission system:
http://marmoset.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/

There are **two types** of Marmoset tests:
- Public (basic / simple) tests results are available immediately and provide simple feedback to ensure your program is “runnable”. Public tests do not thoroughly test your code.  
- Private (comprehensive / correctness) tests are available after the deadline and are used to fully assess your code.

Put comments in code as you go, not at the end
