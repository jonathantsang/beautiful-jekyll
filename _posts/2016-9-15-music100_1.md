monophony: single voice (not necessarily one voice), unaccompanied melody  

homophony: single voice with accompaniment

song texture (homophony):  
- layered  
- melody + accompaniment

chordal harmony (all parts move together, familiar choir texture)  

polyphony:  
- two or more independent voices  
- most difficult to hear  
- "strict" rules called counterpoint rules for combining melodies  
- simple example: rounds ("row, row, row your boat")  

How to do well?  
- pick random songs and try to get the texture of the songs  

metre:
- duple or triple normally

- duple (one, two, one, two)
- triple (strong beat on beat one; one, two, tree, one, two, three, etc.)

Form (pg. 30)  
- two things you can do, repetition doing the same, or something different (contrast)  
- form can be small or on a (very) large scale  
- note potential quiz questions  
- common forms: binary A-B, A-B-A, A-A-B-A  

General Dynamic
- forte, piano, pianissimo

Melodic Range:
- wide for notes that are very high and very low
- folk song, nursery rhyme, few notes used
