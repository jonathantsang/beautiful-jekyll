### Example
**1, 2, 3, 4, 5**  
How many ways can we choose 2 numbers from the above 5, **without replacement**, when **the order in which we choose the numbers is important?**  

$$5^{(2)}$$ = $$\frac{5!}{(5-2)!}$$ = 20  


A pin number of length 4 is formed by randomly selecting and arranging 4 digits from the set {0,1, 2, 3,. . . 9} with replacement.  
Find the probability of the event:  
**A:** The pin number is even.  
**B:** The pin number has only even digits.  
**C:** All of the digits are unique.  
**D:** The pin number contains at least one 1.  

**P(A)** = $$\frac{5 * 10^3}{10^4}$$  


**P(B)** = $$\frac{5^4}{10^4}$$  


**P(C)** = $$\frac{10*9*8*7}{10^4}$$ = $$\frac{10^{(4)}}{10^4}$$  


**P(D)** = $$\frac{10^4-9^4}{10^4}$$  

## Combinations
Any **Unordered (order does not matter)** sequence of k objects taken from a set of n distinct objects is called a **combinations** of size k of the objects denoted  
$$C^k_n = {n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k*n-k!}$$  
Read (n choose k)
For n and k both non-negative integers with n â‰¥ k.  

**Example**
Suppose there are 8 students in a group and that 5 of them must be selected to form a basketball team.  
(a) How many different teams could be formed?  

Use the combination rule with n = 8 and k = 5 as shown below:  
$${8 \choose 5}$$  
$$\frac{8!}{5!3!}$$  
= 56  

**Example**

A committee of 3 is to be formed from a group of 20 people. How many different committees are possible?  
$${20 \choose 3}$$  
$$\frac{20!}{3!17!}$$   
= 1140
