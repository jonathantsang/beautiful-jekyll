## Mutation:  
Python allows us to change the values of variables  
The following Python program is valid:  
x = "a"  
x = 100  
x = 2 * x - 1  

## Local vs Global variables  
Variables defined inside a function are called
local variables  
– Local variables only can be mutated inside the
function they are defined in  

Variables defined outside a function are called
global variables  
– Global variables cannot be mutated inside any
functions in CS116.  

###Correct Usage of Global Variables:
tax_rate = 0.13  
def total_owed(amount):  
    return amount * (1+tax_rate)  

### This Causes an Error:
grade = 87   
def increase_grade(inc):  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grade = grade + inc
increase_grade(5)  

### Mutating Parameters
Consider the program:  

def add1(n):  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n = n + 1  
return n  


starter = 0  
y = add1(starter)  


The value of n is changed locally, but the value of starter is not changed.The mutation of n is a local mutation only.  
Even if starter was called n, the same behaviour would be observed.  

**Tip:**
Python expects each line of code to be an entire statement  
Can be a problem e.g. due to indentation  
If a statement is not done, use a \\ (backslash) character to show it continues on next line  

## Built-in type Bool:
- True, False
- Equality testing: ==
- Use for all atomic values (except for floats)
- Inequality testing:<,<=,>,>=
- != is shorthand for not equal

## Very similar to Scheme
**v1 and v2**  
True only if both v1, v2 are True  
**v1 or v2**  
False only if both v1, v2 are False  
**not v**  
True if v is False , otherwise False  

Like Scheme, Python uses **Short-Circuit evaluation**  
Stop evaluating as soon as answer is known  
**or: stop when one argument evaluates to True**  
**and: stop when one argument evaluates to False**  

## Example of an If Statement

if test: true_action_1 ... true_action_K  

**def double_positive(x):**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result = x  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if x > 0:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result = 2*x  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return result
