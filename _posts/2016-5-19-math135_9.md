## Contrapositive

$$\not$$B $$\rightarrow$$ $$\not$$A $$\equiv$$ A $$\rightarrow$$ B

### When to use Contrapositive:
- when the statement Not A or Not B gives useful information
- if A or B have conditions that are only one of two possibilities (ex. odd or even)

## Proof by Contradiction

A ∧ $$\not$$A must be false.
"A ∧ $$\not$$A must be true" is a Contradiction

### When to use Contradiction:
- when it is difficult to use direct method
- when NOT B gives more useful information than B
