### Flawed Proofs (some examples)

Identify the flaw in the proof  
Statement: 1 = 2.  
Proof: Let a=b  
then $$a^2$$ = ab  
then $$a^2−b^2 = ab−b^2$$  
then (a+b)(a−b) = b(a−b)  
then a+b = b  
then 2b = b  
hence 2 = 1     

In this case, (a-b) can be 0, and you cannot divide both sides by 0. The mistake happens on the third line.

Statement: 4 = 5  
Proof Follow the steps  
−20 = −20  
16 − 36 = 25 − 35  
$$4^2 −9*4=5^2 −9*5\\
4^2−2*4*(\frac{9}{2})^2+ 2 = 5^2−2*5*\frac{9}{2}+\frac{9}{2}\\
(4−\frac{9}{2})^2 = (5-\frac{9}{2})^2\\
4 - \frac{9}{2} = 5 - \frac{9}{2}\\
4 = 5$$

In this case you cannot get rid of the exponents on both sides. The mistake happens on the fifth line.
