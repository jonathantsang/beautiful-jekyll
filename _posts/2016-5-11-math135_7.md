## Union  
S ∪ T = {x \| (x ∈ S ) ∨ (x ∈ T )}  

## Intersection  

S ∩ T = {x \| (x ∈ S) ∧ (x ∈ T)}  

## Set Difference  
Set of all elements in S but not T.

S - T = {x \| (x ∈ S) and ∉ T} = {x \| (x ∈ S) ∧ (x ∉ T)}

## Complement  
\_  
S = {x | x ∉ S}  

## CartesianProduct  
S × T ={ (x,y) \|x ∈ S,y ∈ T}  

What common sets do the following sets refer to?  
**A** {m ∈ $$\mathbb{Z}$$:2\|m} ∪ {2k + 1:k ∈ Z}  
**B** {m ∈ $$\mathbb{Z}$$:2\|m} ∩ {2k + 1:k ∈ Z}  

**A** This is the set of **all integers**

**B** This is an **empty set**

A set S is called a subset of a set T, written S ⊆ T, when the implication “if x ∈ S then x ∈ T” is true for every x in the universe of discourse.  
To prove S ⊆ T , **we prove the implication (x ∈ S) => (x ∈ T).**

Prove:

{n ∈ $$\mathbb{N}$$ : 5 \| n + 2} ⊆ {2k + 1 : k ∈ $$\mathbb{N}$$}  

when n = 8  

8 ∈ {n ∈ $$\mathbb{N}$$ : 5 \| n + 2}  

but 8 ∉ {2k + 1 : k ∈ $$\mathbb{N}$$}  

## Converse of DIC (Divisibility of Integer Combinations)  

If for any integers x and y, a \| (bx + cy)  
Then a | b and a | c  

**Proof:**
Assume for any integer x,y a \| (bx + cy)  
then when x = 1, y = 0  
a \| (b(1) + c(0)), i.e. a \| b  
**Use specific scenarios when it is true**  
then when x = 0, y = 1  
a \| (b(0) + c(1)), i.e. a \| c  

## Converse in Sets

To prove S ⊆ T we prove the implication  
x ∈ S and x ∈ T  
Two sets S and T are equal i.e. S = T,  
S and T have the same elements  

[(x ∈ S) ∧ (x ∈ T) AND (x ∈ T) ∧ (x ∈ S)]  

i.e. we prove  
(1) S ⊆ T  
(2) T ⊆ S
