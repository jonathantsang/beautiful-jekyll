## CS 136 Midterm Notes

module: provides a collection of functions that share a common aspect or purpose.

## modularization:
- sharing among a team is easier
- can use helper function that help other functions
- good style to store each module in a separate file (if it breaks, fix module, not whole program)
main reasons for modularization:
- re-usability: re-used and construct large programs more easily
- maintainability: easier to test and debug a single module
- abstraction: understand what functionality it provides, but not need to understand how it is implemented

terminology:
- client requires functions that a module provides
- module dependency graph cannot have any cycles
- root or main file acts as a client

## Scope:
- local only visible inside of the local region (or function body) where it is defined
- global identifiers are defined at the top level and are visible to all code following the definition

global can have either program or module scope:
- module identifiers are only visible in the module(file) they are defined in
- program identifiers are visible outside of the module they are defined in

Module Interface
- module interface is a list of functions that the module provides
- implementation is the code, interface is what the client would need to use the module
- interface is provided, implementation is hidden

Interface documentation:
- overall description of the module
- list of functions it provides
- contract and purpose for each provided function
- white box tests cannot be tested by a client

Designing Modules:
- high cohesion all interface functions work towards a "common goal"
- low coupling little interaction between modules

![Coupling Info](/classes/3a/cs136/coupling.png)

##Interface vs Implementation
- information hiding where the interface is designed to hide any implementation details from the client
- security is important because it prevents the client from tampering with data used by the module
- flexibility to change the implementation in the future

Data structures and abstract data types
- abstract data type
- implemented as data storage modules and the implementation is hidden from the client

dictionary adt:
- lookup: keys and retrieve corresponding value
- insert: add a new key/value pair
- remove: deletes a key and its value

stack: only touch top
queue: lineup
sequence: line where remove anywhere in adt

stack:
push: add new item to top
pop: remove top item
top: returns the top item
is-empty: determines if it is empty

queue:
add-back: add item to the end
remove-front: remove from the front
front: returns the item at the front
is-empty: determines if the queue is empty

sequence:
item-at: returns the item at given position
insert-at: insert new item at given position
remove-at: removes an item at given position
length: return number of items in sequence

C names must start with a letter, and only contain letters, underscores, and numbers

## Typing:
Racket uses dynamic typing: the type of the identifier is determined while the program is running
C uses static typing: the type of the identifier must be known before the program is run. (The type is declared in the definition and cannot change)

Initialization:
```
const int my_number = 42;
```
"= 42" is called the initialization

C operators
- (+, -, \*, \/)
- / operator rounds towards zero

The % operator: (remainder)
- modulo
- 21 % 2 = 1

## Function Terminology:
- call a function, function is passed, returns a value

## Entry Point:
- OS needs to know where to start, this is called the entry point
- most languages entry point is at the top, for C the entry point is the special function main
- main successful is zero, and if an error occurs it is non-zero
- return optional, defaults to zero
- printf part of C stdio (standard i/o module)
- "%04d\n" pad with 0s to make it 4 digits long
- similar to Racket, C short-circuits and stops evaluating an expression when the value is known

## Functions
- a function (or identifier) must be declared before any expression it appears in
- a **declaration** communicates to C the type of an identifier
- subtle difference between definition and declaration
- declaration: specifies the type of an identifier (like a movie trailer)
- definition instructs C to "create" the identifier (definition includes a declaration) (the actual movie)
- extern declares variables but not defined

## C Modules:
- no built-in functions in C
- standard modules (or libraries) with many useful functions
- stdio standard module provides the printf function
- some assert, stdbool, limits, string, stdlib
- to include stdio module:
\#include <stdio.h>
- to include a "regular" module:
\#include "mymodule.h"

## Creating a Module in C
- place interface and the implementation into separate files
- interface (.h) we place declarations for the functions and variables that the module provides
- in the implementation (.c) we place all of the definitions

## \#include
- preprocessor directive

## Scope
- Racket each global identifier has module scope
- C each global identifier has program scope
- to declare a C global function or variable has module scope, 'static' keyword is used
- C cannot have any top-level expressions

## Assert standard module
- assert(e) stops when the expression s is false, and if e is true, nothing happens
- assert the requirements when feasible

## bool type:
- stdbool standard module

## floating point type
- inexact numbers in Racket
- double is still inexact but has significantly better precision

## Structures
(struct posn (x y))  (in C)
```
struct posn {
  int x;
  int y;
};
```
- structure operator (.) which selects the value from the requested field
- equality operator does not work with structures, must define own equality function
- "return {px. * f, p.y * f}" is INVALID

## Chapter 4: Imperative C
- functional means to produce a value depending only on the parameters
- functional programming paradigm is to only use constant values that never change, functions produce new ones rather than existing ones
- imperative uses a sequence of statements to give instructions to the computer
- begin in C is similar to local in Racket

## Side Effects
- printf is a side effect with output
- functional programming has no side effects
- add effects to a contract if there are any side effects
- printf returns the number of characters printed
- expression statement is followed by a semicolon, and the value at the end of the expression is ignored

## Block Statements
- a block ({}) is a compound statement that contains a sequence of statements
- a C block ({}) is similar to Racket's begin statemetns that are evaluated in sequence
- a block ({}) does not "produce" a value, so return is needed
- a block can contain local scope definitions which are not statements
two types of C statements:
- compound statements (a sequence of statements)
- expression statements (for producing side effects)
- other type is control flow statements

## Control Flow Statements
- return leaves a function to return a value
- if (and else) statements execute statements conditionally

![Coupling Info](/classes/3a/cs136/cterminology.png)

## State
- defining imperative programming paradigm is the manipulative state
- state 'moment in time'
- in a program each variable is in a specific state
- functional programming, each variable has only one possible state
- imperative programming, each variable can be one of many possible states
- hence the name variable can change during the execution of the program

## Mutation
- changing variable
- good style to use const
- mutation achieved with assignment operator (=)
```
int m = 5; //initialization
m = 28;    //assignment operator
```

= used in initialization is **not** the assignment operator

- functional programming paradigm, a function cannot have any side effects and the value it produces depends only on the parameters
- imperative programming paradigm a function may have side effects and its behaviour may depend on the state of the program

prefer:
++x;
--x;  
over:  
x++;
x--;

## Chapter 5 Memory and Control Flow
- one bit of storage (in memory) has two possible states: 0 or 1
- a byte is 8 bits in store, each byte in memory is in one of the 256 possible states
- position of the byte is the address

C encounters a variable definition:
- reserves or finds space in memory to store a variable
- "keeps track of" the address of that storage location
- stores the initial value of the variable at that location

- variable definition reserves space, but a declaration does not.

## sizeof for int
- how much space in memory depends on the type of variable
- size operator produces the number of bytes to store a type
- int is 4 bytes, only $$2^32$$ possible values (4,294,967,296)
- %zd is placeholder for a size
- int storage in memory is 4 consecutive bytes of memory
- integer limits -$$2^{31}$$ to $$2^{31}$$-1
- using #include<limits.h> has constants INT_MIN and INT_MAX

overflow occurs when it goes under the int_min or over the int_max

## char type
- one byte of storage for a char
- $$2^8$$ (256) possible values for a char and the range of values (-128, ... 127)

## ASCII

## C Characters
- single quotes (') use to indicate ASCII characters
```
char letter_a = 'a';
char ninety_seven - 97;
```
both are the exact same

## Sructure in Memory
- only reserved when a struct variable is defined
- amount of space is **at least** the sum of sizeof each field, but may be larger
- floats have more precision, more memory used

## Sections of Memory
- code, read-only data, global data, heap, stack
- section combined into memory segments
- memory outside is a segmentation fault

## Code
- converted to machine code that is 'machine readable'
- machine code placed in code section

## Read-only and Global Data Sections
- global variables are placed in read-only data section (constants) OR global data section (mutable variables)
- global variables' space is reserved before the program begins execution
- code from program (and modules) is scanned and all global variables are identified
- next space for each global variable is reserved
- memory is properly initialized, this happens before main is called

## Control Flow
- keep track of program location
- when a function is called, the program jumps to the start of the function
- return "returns" back to the location of the calling function
- location to remember where to jump back is called the "return address"

## Call Stack
- history is known as the call stack
- each time a function is called, a new entry is pushed to the stack
- when return occurs the entry is popped off the stack

# Stack Frames
- entries pushed onto the call stack are known as stack frames
- each function call creates a stack frame
stack frame contains:
- argument values
- local variables
- return address

- with Racket, before a function is called, all of the arguments must be values
- C makes a COPY of each argument value and places the copy in the stack frame
- space for local variable is only reserved **when the function is called**
- space is reserved within a newly created stack frame
- when the function returns the variable (and the entire frame) is popped and effectively "disappears"

## Stack Section
- bottom of the stack is placed at the highest available memory address

## Uninitialized Memory
- all global variables will automatically initialize the variable to zero
- local variable has an arbitrary initial value

## Model
- state has combination of program location and memory
- calling a function is control flow
- stack frame is created
- copy of argument is placed in the stack frame
- current program location is placed in the stack frame as the return address
- program location is changed to the start of the new function
- initial values of local variables are set when their definition is encountered

## Return
- when it returns current program location changes back to the return address
- stack frame is removed ("popped from Stack memory")

If Statement

## Loops
- while(expression) statement
- loops repeatedly until the expression is false
- a **copy** of each argument is passed to the function, so the function sum is free to mutate its own copy of k

## While Errors
- endless loops

## Do While
- statement is always executed at least once, and the expression is checked at the end of the loop

## Break
- break form  the middle of a loop
- terminates from the (innermost) loop
- usually breaks a (purposefully) infinite loop

## Continue
- control flow statement that skips over the rest of the statements in the current block ({}) and "continues" with the loop

## For Loop
- for(setup; expression; update) { body statement(s) }
- setup can include a definition

## Chapter 6 Pointers

## Address Operator
- expose underlying memory model
- address operator (&) produces the starting address of where the value of an identifier is stored in memory
- printf placeholder to display an address is "%p"
- storing an address a pointer
- value of a pointer of a address
- size of a pointer is always 8 bytes (regardless of type of data stored at that address)

## Indirection Operator
- (\*) known as the dereference operator is the inverse of (&)
- \*p produces the value of what pointer p "points at"

## Pointers to Pointers
- pointer p points to p is an error
```
int *p = &p;
```

## Null Pointer
- points to "nothing" or "invalid"
- if you dereference a NULL pointer, the program will probably will likely crash

## Function Pointers
- Racket, functions are first-class values
- Racket functions are values stored in variables and data structures
- in C, functions are not first-class values, but **function pointers** are
```
int add 1(int i) {return i + 1;}

int main(void){
    int (*fp)(int) = add1;
    printf("add1(3) = %d\n", fp(3));
  }

add1(3) = 4
```
## Mutation & Parameters
- "pass by value" in C, copy of an argument is passed to a function
- "pass by reference" where a variable is passed to a function can be changed by the function
- C can emulate pass by reference by passing the address of the variable we want the function to change (still considered "pass by value" since we pass the **value** of the address)

- don't return an address in its stack frame because all memory within the frame should be considered invalid

## Passing Structures
- a **copy** of each argument value is placed into a stack frame, for large struct this can be inefficient
- arrow selection operator (->) combines the indirection and the selection operators

## Const Parameters and Pointers
```
void cannot_change(const struct posn *p){
    p->x = 5; // INVALID
}
```
p can change, but must always point at a const int
The rule is "const" applies to the type to the left of it, unless it's first, and then it applies to the type to the right of it.
```
int my_function(const int x){
    //mutation of x here is invalid
    // ...
}
```
Because a **copy** of the argument is made for the stack, it does not matter if the original argument value is constant or not. A **const** parameter communicates that **the copy** will not be mutated

## Opaque Structures in C
```
struct posn; // INCOMPLETE

struct posn my_posn; // INVALID
struct posn *posn_ptr // VALID
```

## Chapter 7 I/O Testing
Input & Output (I/O for short)
- scanf("%d", &i); // read in an integer, store in i
- return value of scanf is the number of values successfully read in
```
count = scanf("%d", &i);

if (count != 1){
    printf("Fail! I could not read in an integer!\n");")
}
```
scanf("%d", &i) will ignore whitespace (spaces and newlines) and read in the next integer
If the next non-whitespace input to be read in is not a valid integer (e.g. a letter), it will stop reading and return zero

## Chapter 8 Arrays and Strings
- two built-in "compound" data storage:
structures and arrays
```
int my_array[6] = {4,8,15,16,23,42}
```
- **fixed number** of elements and all have the **same type**
- to define an array we know the **length** of the array in advance
- each individual value in the array is known as an element
- to access an element, its index is required
- index starts at 0
- entire array cannot be assigned at once
- each individual element must be mutated
- unitialized **global** arrays are zero-filled
- unitialized **local** arrays are filled with arbitrary ("garbage") values from the stack
- remaining values are initialized to zero (even with local arrays)
```
int b[5] = {1,2,3}; // b[3] & b[4] = 0
int c[5] = {0}; // c[0] ... c[4] = 0
```
length can be omitted and automatically determined from number of elements in initialization
```
int b[]; // INVALID
```
Only valid if the array is initialized

## Array Size
- length if number of elements in the array
- size is the number of bytes it occupies in memory
- array of k elements is, each size s is k x s bytes

Array of siz elements (int a[6]) is (6 x 4 = 24)

C does not keep track of the array length as part of the array data structure

## Array identifier
- value of an array (a) is the same as the **address** of the array (&a) which is also the address of the first element (&a[0])

## Passing Arrays to Functions
- only the **address** of the array is copied to the stack frame, this is more efficient than copying the entire array to the stack

## Pointer Arithmetic
- if p is a pointer, (p + 1) **depends on the type** of the pointer p
- (p + 1) adds the sizeof whatever p points at
- rule is p + i x sizeof(\*p)
- subtracting works the same way
- mutable pointers can be incremented or decremented (++p is equivalent to p = p + 1)
- can't add two pointers
- subtract two pointers if they are the same type:
(p - q)/sizeof(\*p)
- pointers of the same type can be compared with comparison operators <,<=, ==, !=, >=, >

## Pointer Arithmetic and Arrays
- a[i] is equivalent to \*(a + 1)

## Array Map
```
// effects: replaces each element a[i] with f(a[i])
  void array_map(int (*f)(int), int a[], int len) {
    for (int i=0; i < len; ++i) {
      a[i] = f(a[i]);
    }
}
```
