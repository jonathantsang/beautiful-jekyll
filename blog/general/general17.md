**Note**: I released this on Dec 13th and I didn't realize Taylor Swift and Kid Cudi dropped records in the last ~3 weeks of 2020 (Both on Dec 11th). I will amend the list once I give them a listen.

This is a short post on what I found were the best albums this year. This year had a little less releases compared to 2019 but still had some standouts. After writing this list and reflecting, I realized there is a lot of electronic-based albums (3 of top 5). I didn't plan it out this way but there really wasn't any compelling rap albums (which is my main genre) released recently. I wasn't able to listen to every album release this year but I listened to a fair amount.

**Other Albums from 2020:**
- Wonder (Shawn Mendes)
- Eternal Atake (Lil Uzi Vert)
- Allegory (Royce Da 5'9")
- Blame it on Baby (Da Baby)
- evermore (Taylor Swift)
- Man on the Moon III (Kid Cudi)

**Honourable Mentions:**
- After Hours (The Weeknd)
- No Pressure (Logic)


### 5. The Slow Rush - Tame Impala 

<img src="/blog/general/17/tsr.jpg" width="50%" height="50%"/>

**Genre:** Psychedelic pop, Soft rock, Electronic, Synth Pop, Disco

Rooted in psychedelic disco music, the album is soft rock and about what you can expect from Tame Impala in crooning, psychelic sounds, and moody undertones. It's a good album that has high points as well as low points that are a bit forgettable.

**Score:** 5.5/10

**Best tracks:** Posthumunous Forgiveness, Borderline, Instant Destiny

**Worst tracks:** Breathe Deeper, Tomorrow's Dust

### 4. Manic - Halsey

**Genre:** Alternative

This album probably flew under most people's radars. It just barely makes it into 2020 being released on January 17, 2020. (Which contrasts Roddy Rich's "Please Excuse me for being Antisocial" which barely didn't make the cut, being released on December 6, 2019)

The album is a cohesive mess. Staying true to the album's title it is manic and anything but calming. That being said it plays to its strengths and follows the theme with a fairly straightforward theme of "being yourself" whatever that may be. This album feels like a revelation to the people who feel they don't fit into a clean niche.

It could almost be described as Melodramatic with songs like "I HATE EVERYBODY". The song's name is hyperbole, but listening to the song it is more relateable than alienating upon a second glance. 

**Score:** 6.5/10

**Best tracks:** I HATE EVERYBODY, You should be sad, Forever ... (is a long time), Still Learning, 929, Ashley

**Worst tracks:** SUGA's Interlude, killing boys, clementine

### 3. Future Nostalgia - Dua Lipa

<img src="/blog/general/17/fn.png" />

**Genre:** Dance, Pop, Disco

The spacious synth heavy album drips of pop infused with electronic influences. Atmospheric and The first album I think of when I heard the intro was Nightcall by Kavinsky. The album feels like a drive in the dark down a corridor only illuminated by the moon. It embodies a lot of the electronic sounds to fuse pop and disco sounds that creates an aesthetic that is pretty appealing.

I have to dedicate time to talk about the legendary sample of Lew Stone & the Monseigneur Band feat. Al Bowlly and their song My Woman on the song Love Again. The last time I heard that melancholy trumpet sound being sampled was White Town on their song Your Woman.

The album has a great first half but slowly falls off near the end. Luckily the good parts are fairly consistent, the album has a tight 11 songs, and has little filler. This album is pretty popular and would probably be my go-to in recommending an album to someone looking for a good album to check out this year. (This album isn't some hidden gem, I assume most streaming sites only have the singles on rotation)

**Score:** 7.5/10

**Best tracks:** Love Again, Don't Start Now, Future Nostalgia, Levitating, Physical, Break My Heart, Cool, Boys Will be Boys

**Worst tracks:** Pretty please, Good in Bed

### 2. Folklore - Taylor Swift

<img src="/blog/general/17/f.png" />

**Genres:** Pop, Folktronica, Alternative rock, Indie folk

Taylor Swift follows up her 2019 album Lover, an album largely centered around joyous pop, to Folklore her most dark and depressing album to date. Lover was a large directional change towards pop as opposed to a lot of her previous music which had a majority of country with pop influence.

Folklore is bare and minimalistic at times. Songs like betty feel barebones only really putting spotlight on the guitar and vocals. It's hard to ignore some of Lana Del Rey's influences on songs like cardigan with the existential dread, heavy breathing, and moody swings. It's not a bad thing but it almost feels like an one-off song on the album despite the other tones on other songs.

This album is also a good recommendation since I dont't think these songs are going to have the same pop appeal and catchy single frenzy seen in previous Taylor Swift album songs. I still really enjoyed the album in a different way from "Future Nostalgia" but liked what it provided.

**Score:** 7.5/10

**Best tracks:** Exile, Betty, Illicit Affairs, Tears Ricochet, Mirrorball, Invisible String

**Worst tracks:** cardigan, Hoax

### 1. The New Abnormal - The Strokes

<img src="/blog/general/17/tna.png" />

**Genre:** Alternative/Indie (Rock), Synth Pop

I didn't quite know what to expect when first listening to this album. What we got was a lot of songs fusing synth sounds with pop to create an indie-like sound. The album can be summed up to many New York references and creative sounds merge to create something pretty great.

**Score:** 8/10

**Best tracks:** Ode to the Mets, At the door, Selfless, Brooklyn Bridge to the Chrous

**Worst tracks:** none
