#### YES

Putting this into an official post since I talk about this all the time. I'll ask you what your favourite Kanye album is, and you music taste is more often than not indicative of what you say. (There are a lot of right answers. Saying the "singles" or "I don't know any of the albums" unfortunately is a subpar answer.)

I don't count/haven't delved deep enough into:
- Watch the Throne
- Cruel Summer
- Kids See Ghosts (I listened to this and I do not like it)

I am ranking these 9 albums:
- The College Dropout
- Late Registration
- Graduation
- 808s and Heartbreak
- Yeezus
- My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy
- The Life of Pablo (TLOP)
- Ye
- Jesus is King

## 9. Yeezus - 2013

Yeezus tried to push the experimental envelope towards younger audiences with newer sounds. Unfortunately I was not the target demographic and I felt there was very little to take away from the album.

best: bound 2

worst: rest of the album

## 8. Jesus is King - 2019

Kanye's most recent release that follows a similar formula to Kids See Ghosts and Ye in being short and concise (at least in the tracklist).

I didn't care much for the themes of the album and the only real redeeming qualities are taking the album not as seriously like on "Closed on Sunday" with those Chick-fil-a lines.

best: Use this gospel, Closed on Sunday

worst: water

## 7. Ye - 2018

This album I feel is underrated but also lacking substance. It may not be fair to criticize a short album of just 7 songs and under 24 minutes.

The album is more of a meditative look at mental health (headlined by the album cover saying "I hate being bipolar. It's awesome.")

I can __maybe__ see this overtaking Graduation in the future. But for now it is at 7th.

best: I thought about killing you, violent crimes

worst:

## 6. Graduation - 2008

I did a re-listen to this album recently and it did not age well in a lot of aspects. At the time it was heralded as a futuristic shiny forward direction for the sound. By today's standards it does feel drawn out and not cutting edge (which makes sense since it has been almost 12 years since the release). A lot of the glitzy and glamour from the songs seem just incredibly cheesy. For example "Good Life", which was a great song just feels too formulaic.

best: Stronger, Homecoming, Champion

worst: Barry bonds, Drunk and Hot Girls

## 5. The Life of Pablo - 2016

This album grew on my since the initial listen. This may be in part to the fact that the album was literally changed from the inception, with changes to Wolves, Famous, adding Saint Pablo, etc.

Initially I was not impressed with this album. It can be summed up with the "I Love Kanye" skit where a lot of fans wanted something "like the old Kanye".

best: Famous, Waves, FML, Saint Pablo, Real Friends, No More Parties in LA

worst: Fade, Father Stretch My Hands, Pt. 1, Low Lights, Feedback, Facts

## 4. 808s and Heartbreak

In terms of "black sheeps", this album is essentially the "black sheep of black sheeps". You can make a case for Ye or TLOP but I would argue 808s and Heartbreak is the most different and most divisive Kanye album of his entire discography. It relies on a lot of the motifs, themes, and sounds from earlier Kanye albums but dealt in a much more delicate and grief-stricken way due to the departure of Kanye's album which sparked the album. Unlike Ye or TLOP it could even be regarded as not really a rap album (which Ye and TLOP at least share in similarity with the rest of the discography).



## 3. Late Registration - 2005



## 2. The College Dropout - 2004

The start of Kanye's humble beginnings in Chicago. The album itself has great tracks, good skits, and a (hilariously) good narrative. Kanye chose to reject the ideas of "formal schooling" and rejected the outside naysayers to create a hip hop album when it was not meant to be about being fashionable, self-critical, loving your family, on top of other song topics.

The samples are great on this album (as with a lot of his albums) and most prevalently shown in this due to a lot of material either being from previous mixtapes (I'm Good...	, Get Well Soon, etc.) and his general focus on production prior to his rap career.

best: two words, jesus walks, through the wire, last call, we don't care, all falls down, never let me down, family business

worst: breathe in breathe out

## 1. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy - 2010

TCD and MBDTF are very close in terms of which is better. They do represent a lot of different ideas and quality-wise are very different. Almost every song on TCD are great, while MBDTF has some amazing songs, and a few very bad duds.



best: power, gorgeous, hell of a life, devil in a new dress, blame game (sans chris rock outro), dark fantasy, runaway, lost in the world

worst: all of the lights
