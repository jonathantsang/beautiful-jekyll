Watchmen is my favourite superhero movie. It beats out movies like `The Dark Knight`, `The Dark Knight Rises`, `Incredibles`, `Iron Man`, `Joker`, etc. I'm also going to say that I've seen a few Marvel movies but not the extensive list.

**note:** Spoilers on the plot of Watchmen. If you haven't seen it, go see it. And go read the graphic novel too.
