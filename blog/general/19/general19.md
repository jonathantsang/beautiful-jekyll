**Note:** Spoilers on movie ending/

Looking forwards and backwards TENET is an unenjoyable, drawn out, and flawed film.

I didn't like TENET. I love Christopher Nolan's past discography with films like "The Prestige", "Inception" (albeit I think a little overrated), "The Dark Knight" series, and "Memento" being among my favourite movies of all time. I finished watching TENET and walked away disappointed.

The premise of the movie is explained in the trailers and really isn't surprise to most watchers. It alludes to this concept of time moving forwards and backwards which the user can utilize. We don't know **how** things are inverted, but we slowly realize there are turnstiles that invert objects.

### Beginning

The Kiev Opera intro scene was incredibly confusing and almost to a fault I felt was a rushed mess for the watcher. It drove home some plot points to be used later on in the film but I tried to later on build greater connections to that scene to later film knowledge and all I remember is the running around and the protagonist's sense of saving the civilians.

Then the plot goes into the future wanting to invert the past and delves into the "grandfather paradox".

### What I liked

the concept is clever and although a bit miscontrued at times, makes sense (mostly)

clever allusions

robert pattison (Neil) steals the show honestly.

### What I didn't like

predictability

I had a feeling about two things

firstly that the switzerland fight scene would be reversed

the "masked" people were neil and the protagonist, maybe a hunch but it felt so scripted to be played back (and it was)

A lot of action was incredibly fast-paced and hard to keep track of.

The painting metaphor for "real" and "fake"

### The Ending

It makes sense. Neil inverted himself again to get the door unlocked and saved them in the end.
**My Rating:** 2/5
