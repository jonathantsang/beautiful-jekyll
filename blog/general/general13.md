### Harvey Dent - Dark Knight

> You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain


### Erik Killmonger - Black Panther

> The child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth

This isn't a quote from Erik Killmonger but it encapsulates his entire motive. Killmonger is by far the most compelling thing about the movie. The premise is the contrast between past vs present, and tradition vs innovation.

### Veidt - Watchmen

> And so began my path to conquest. Conquest not of men, but of the evils that beset them.


### Andrew Laeddis - Shutter Island

> My name is Edward Daniels this one's loaded I could tell by my initials are on the side, there's a dent in the barrel from when Philip Stack shot at me you're not gonna fuck with my mind doctor!
