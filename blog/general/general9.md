### Fallout New Vegas - Dead Money

<img src="/blog/general/9/intro.jpg" />

Fallout New Vegas released the first DLC expansion `Dead Money` in 2010. I played it for the first time in 2020. This post is not as much about WHAT the DLC was as opposed to looking at it (almost) a decade later and seeing what themes arise from it.

### The DLC

If I'm going to be honest the DLC is rough. It has great companions...that you utilize for a very short amount of time. Dog, Christine, and Dean Domino all had great stories and personalities but only followed you for a short amount of time. The ticking time bomb from the collar interacting with radio frequencies is really annoying. The casino which is arguably the biggest and most grandiose part of the DLC, is maybe 30% of the DLC at most. 70% is wandering around the villa area, which is both dark, confusing, and really annoying. The sierra madre chip currency.

It is hardly fair to compare it against Skyrim DLC, Fallout 4 DLC (which I never played), Borderlands 2 DLC, Arkham Series DLC etc. DLC has evolved over the years and 10 years ago I would probably describe the entire DLC as pretty good for the time.

This post is not about the actual gameplay of the DLC. I wanted to talk about the themes of it and how it ties it together.

**note:** Spoilers for story and missions of the DLC.

### Intro

The start of the DLC starts with you entering a Brotherhood of Steel bunker and listening to a radio as a red mist knocks you out.

### Dead Money

> In poker, dead money is the amount of money in the pot other than the equal amounts bet by active remaining players in that pot. Examples of dead money include money contributed to the pot by players who have folded, a dead blind posted by a player returning to a game after missing blinds, or an odd chip left in the pot from a previous deal.

> The term "dead money" is also used in a derogatory sense to refer to money put in the pot by players who are still legally eligible to win it, but who are unlikely to do so because they are unskilled, increasing the expected return of other players. This can also be applied to the player himself: "Let's invite John every week; he's dead money". The term "dead money" also applies in tournaments, when many casual players enter events with virtually no chance of winning.

### Greed

### Letting Go

> It's still out there, in the Wastes, preserved, just waiting for someone to crack it open. But getting to it. That's not the hard part. It's letting go.

Gambling plays a large part in the DLC both from a story-driven aspect where you literally go to a casino and a stylistic aesthetic.

### The End

> The Courier, lured by the promises of the Sierra Madre, could not escape. Once inside the vault, the casino did not let go.
