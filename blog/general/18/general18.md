Super late list but after making the 2020 list I wanted to make one for 2019. This is a short post on what I found were the best albums of 2019. Another year of pretty lackluster rap releases. 

**Other Albums from 2020:**
- Jesus is King (Kanye West)
- All my Heroes are Cornballs (JPEGMAFIA)
- uknowwhatimsayin? (Danny Brown)
- thank u, next (Ariana Grande)
- All Mirros (Angel Olsen)
- MAGDALENE (FKA twigs)

**Honourable Mentions:**
- Lover (Taylor Swift)

### 5. Please excuse me for being antisocial - Roddy Rich

**Genre:** Hip hop, Trap

I thought this album was just about what to expect from modern rap and trap album releases.

I actually didn't like "The Box", the album's single that much.

**Score:** 6/10

**Best tracks:** Gods Eyes, Bacc Seat, Prayers to the Trap God, Tip Toe

**Worst tracks:** The Box

### 4. Igor - Tyler the Creator

**Genre:** Alternative

This album needs to be listened to front to back. I don't see it making sense otherwise. This is an example of one of the albums I think lack so much context when listening to songs individually on a streaming site like Spotify.

**Score:** 6.5/10

**Best tracks:** EARFQUAKE, GONE GONE / THANK YOU, I THINK, NEW MAGIC WAND

**Worst tracks:** 

### 3. When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? - Billie Ellish

<img src="/blog/general/17/wwafawdwg.png" />

**Genre:** Alternative


**Score:** 7/10

**Best tracks:** bad guy,

**Worst tracks:** 

### 2. Father of the Bride - Vampire Weekend

<img src="/blog/general/17/f.png" />

**Genres:** Alternative

Imagine Chance's "The Big Day" but now didn't suck and was actually pretty good (and wasn't rap but that isn't a detractor). That's why Vampire Weekend's "Father of the Bride" is 2nd on my albums for 2019.

Focused around matrimony, love, heartbreak, and promiscuity, the album is an album centered around the themes and love of life, marriage.

**Score:** 8.5/10

**Best tracks:** Bambina, Hold you now, 2021, We belong together, This Life, How Long?, Harmony Hall,

**Worst tracks:** 

### 1. Norman Fucking Rockwell - Lana Del Rey

<img src="/blog/general/18/nfr.png" />

**Genre:** Pop

This album is **fucking** good. I didn't find an album that painted both grand imagery of California with the despair and tragedy of a character like 

Expansive sounds

California imagery

There is the depiction of her tragic character with undertones of a love not requited, forgotten, or in many cases just doomed from the start.

"Fuck it I love you" has an album version and a "single version" played on most streaming sites like Spotify and Apple Music. I actually like both versions. The album version is more bare and drips in sadness from the vocals and backing track being the only sounds. The single version is more bombastic, triumphant, and has the backing drum track in the background.

"Happiness is a Butterfly" has lines like

> If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst That can happen to a girl who's already hurt? I'm already hurt

The album ends off with a song titled "hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have - but I have it", capping off the epic story of sadness riddles songs with renewed hope, which in context of the album's songs only perpetuates the sadness of hope. The dichotomy of hope not being a beacon of shining light, but only more of the same of what was stated on the album.

**Score:** 9/10

**Best tracks:** Happiness is a Butterfly, Fuck it I love you, California, The Greatest, Love Song, The Next Greatest American Record, How to disappear, Venice Bitch, Cinnamon Girl, Doin' Time

**Worst tracks:** none
