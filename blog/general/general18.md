Super late list but after making the 2020 list I wanted to make one for 2019. This is a short post on what I found were the best albums of 2019. 

**Other Albums from 2020:**
- Jesus is King (Kanye West)
- All my Heroes are Cornballs (JPEGMAFIA)

**Honourable Mentions:**
- Lover (Taylor Swift)

### 5. Please excuse me for being antisocial - Roddy Rich

**Genre:** R&B, Psychedelic pop

I will admit I haven't delved deep into The Weeknd's discography. This album was a decent foray into the pop sounds mixed with darker themes brought upon the "After Hours" name of hedonism. It incorporates ideas of "being unable to be loved" and "promiscuity, overindulgence, and self-loathing".

**Score:** 6/10

**Best tracks:** 

**Worst tracks:** 

### 4. Igor - Tyler the Creator

**Genre:** Alternative

This album needs to be listened to front to back. I don't see it making sense otherwise. This is an example of one of the albums I think lack so much context when listening to songs individually on a streaming site like Spotify.

**Score:** 6.5/10

**Best tracks:** Earthquake

**Worst tracks:** 

### 3. When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? - Billie Ellish

<img src="/blog/general/17/wwafawdwg.png" />

**Genre:** Dance, Pop, Disco


**Score:** 8/10

**Best tracks:** Love Again, Don't Start Now, Future Nostalgia, Levitating, Physical, Break My Heart, Cool, Boys Will be Boys

**Worst tracks:** Pretty please, Good in Bed

### 2. Father of the Bride - Vampire Weekend

<img src="/blog/general/17/f.png" />

**Genres:** 

**Score:** 8.5/10

**Best tracks:** Bambina, Hold you now, 2021, We belong together, This Life, How Long

**Worst tracks:** 

### 1. Norman Fucking Rockwell - Lana Del Rey

<img src="/blog/general/18/nfr.png" />

**Genre:** Alternative/Indie (Rock), Synth Pop



**Score:** 9/10
